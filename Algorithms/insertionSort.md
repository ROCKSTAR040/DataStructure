## Algorithm

 step 1: Start
 
 step 2: set i = 0
 
 step 3: if i<n continue to step 4 else go to step 8
 
 step 4: Set j = i-1 and current = arr[i]
 
 step 5: if arr[j] > current and j >=0 continue to step 6 else go to step 7
 
 step 6: a[j+1]=a[j] and set j = j-1 and go to step 5
 
 step 7: Set a[j+1]= current and go to step 3
 
 step 8: Stop

## Algorithm

### step 1: Start
### step 2: Set i = start
### step 3: Set j = end 
### step 4: i++ until element > key is found 
### step 5: j-- until element < key is found 
### step 6: Repeat step 4 and step 5 until j < i and Swap a[i] and a[j] along
### step 7: Swap key and a[i]
### step 8: Stop
